# Numpy went to version 2 on June 16th 2024.
# OpenCV released 4.10.0.84 on June 17th 2024.
# However, scikit-surgerycalibration version 0.2.5,
# specifies opencv-contrib-python-headless opencv-contrib-python-headless<4.6 due to Issue #48.
# If you google, you find lots of changes of opencv between 4.6 and 4.10, e.g. ArUco changes that affect our calibration.
# So, for now, until scikit-surgerycalibration Issue #48 is fixed, so that we can upgrade to
# opencv-contrib-python-headless >= 4.10.0.84 and beyond, numpy must be restricted to <2.0.
